Our process for development includes:

1. Onboarding
2. Project management
3. Discovery
4. Design
5. Coding
6. Quality assurance and testing
7. Client acceptance

## Onboarding

We meet with the client and the members of our team who will be working on the project. Typically this includes:

* a project manager
* a lead developer
* other developers as needed
* the client

## Project management

The project manager keeps track of progress on the project and makes sure there are no blockers.

## Discovery

Find out the details of what needs to be built.

## Design

Create mockups and wireframes. Use tools like Photoshop to define what the site will look like.

## Coding

Programmers get involved.

## Quality assurance

## Client acceptance
